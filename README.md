# StoryCrafter

This is a Next.js application that allows users to co-create magical stories with the help of AI. The app provides a starting point for a story and then lets the user add their own sentences. The AI, with the personality of John Cena, then continues the story, generating unique visuals and audio for each new part.

## Features

- **Collaborative Storytelling:** Users and the AI take turns writing a story.
- **AI Storyteller:** The AI has an enthusiastic and motivational personality, inspired by John Cena.
- **Dynamic Media Generation:** For each part of the story, the application generates:
  - A short, animated video.
  - A fallback image if video generation fails.
  - An audio narration of the story text.

## Prompts

This project uses several Genkit AI prompts to bring the story to life:

1.  **Story Continuation Prompt**
    -   **File:** `src/ai/flows/story-continuation.ts`
    -   **Purpose:** Takes the story written so far and generates the next one or two sentences.
    -   **Personality:** The prompt instructs the AI to be an enthusiastic and motivational storyteller for children, embodying the positive, action-oriented, "never give up" spirit of John Cena.

2.  **Image/Video Prompt Generator**
    -   **File:** `src/app/actions.ts`
    -   **Purpose:** Extracts a concise, visually descriptive phrase from the story text (e.g., "A brave knight in a dark cave"). This phrase is then used as a prompt for the video and image generation models.

3.  **Video Generation Prompt**
    -   **File:** `src/ai/flows/story-video-generation.ts`
    -   **Purpose:** Uses the visual description generated by the `imagePromptGenerator` to create a whimsical, kid-friendly animated video that matches the scene.

4.  **Text-to-Speech Prompt**
    -   **File:** `src/ai/flows/text-to-speech.ts`
    -   **Purpose:** Converts the generated story text into a natural-sounding audio narration, which is then played back in the browser.
